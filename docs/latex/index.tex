\subsubsection*{{\itshape The Bridging Real-\/world Infrastructure Designed to Goal-\/align, Engage, and Stimulate ({\bfseries B\+R\+I\+D\+G\+E\+S}) project is directed at improving the retention of sophomore students in Computer Science by (1) introducing real-\/world datasets (Facebook, Twitter, etc) into course projects involving computer science data structures, and (2) facilitating peer mentoring of sophomores by senior C\+S students in shared lab experiences that involve the use of the B\+R\+I\+D\+G\+E\+S infrastructure in software development.}}

{\bfseries B\+R\+I\+D\+G\+E\+S Client Design }~\newline
 B\+R\+I\+D\+G\+E\+S client side design loosely follows the basic data structure elements implemented and described in ``\+A Practical Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis" by C.\+A. Shaffer (\href{http://people.cs.vt.edu/shaffer/Book/}{\tt http\+://people.\+cs.\+vt.\+edu/shaffer/\+Book/}). These elements are augmented to contain visual properties that are controlled by the user to customize the visual representation of the constructed data structure. Once a a data structure is ready to be visualized, related B\+R\+I\+D\+G\+E\+S server calls are made to send a reprsentation of the data structure to B\+R\+I\+D\+G\+E\+S server.

{\bfseries B\+R\+I\+D\+G\+E\+S Server Design }~\newline
 B\+R\+I\+D\+G\+E\+S server implements a combination of technologies (Mongo\+D\+B, Node, d3\+J\+S(visualization) ) to receive a data structure representation for visualization. These are largely transparent to the user and involves the user being directed to a web page for viewing the data structure. Attention has been paid to provide meaningful error messages to the user in case problems are encountered in the process.
