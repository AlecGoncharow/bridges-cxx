	Issues brought up by Dakota Carmer
	A number of fixes/bugs/inconsistencies.

Notes: 

1. All Bridges classes implemented using templates, consistent with the Java version.
2. Extensive error checking, using Try/Catch exception mechanism
3. Uses C++11 features, so must use the right compiler flags to turn on C++11 features
4. Uses libCurl to connect to the server (not working yet!)
