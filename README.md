# bridges-cxx
This is the BRIDGES C++ Version

Author: Kalpathi Subramanian, June 2015

Notes: 

1. All Bridges classes implemented using templates, consistent with the Java version.
2. Extensive error checking, using Try/Catch exception mechanism
3. Uses C++11 features, so must use the right compiler flags to turn on C++11 features
4. Uses libCurl to connect to the server (not working yet!)
